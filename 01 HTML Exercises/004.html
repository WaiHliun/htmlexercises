			Dear Ms.Nandar<br /><br />
			Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me to discuss selling my 
			handmade sweaters in your shop. As I mention in our conversation, I've been 
			a customer of your shop since I used my third-grade allowance to buy my very 
			first pair of knitting needles.<br />
			I'm honored that you'd consider selling one of my original creations at the 
			Yarn Company alongside your own work. We discussed a trial consignment 
			arrangement in which a&nbsp;portion&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;sales would go to 
			the store. This is more than aggreable to me.<br /><br />
			Thanks<br />
