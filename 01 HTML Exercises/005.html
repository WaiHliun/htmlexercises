		<p>In a previous chapter of study, the variety of ways by which motion can be 
		described (words, graphs, diagrams, numbers, etc.) was discussed. In this unit 
		(Newton's Laws of Motion), the ways in which motion can be explained will be 
		discussed. Isaac Newton (a 17th century scientist) put forth a variety of laws 
		that explain why objects move (or don't move) as they do. These three laws have 
		become known as Newton's three laws of motion. The focus of Lesson 1 is 
		Newton's first law of motion - sometimes referred to as the law of inertia. 
		Newton's first law of motion is often started as 
		<blockquote>An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in 
		motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an 
		unbalanced force.</blockquote>
		There are two clauses or parts to this statement - one that predicts the behavior 
		of stationary objects and the other that predicts the behavior of moving objects.
